        "- Download and load the data (csv file contains ';' as delimiter)\n",

        "- Split the dataset into 85% for training and rest 15% for testing (sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split function)\n",
        "- Follow logistic regression class and fill code where highlighted:\n",
        "    - Write sigmoid function to predict probabilities\n",
        "    - Write cross entropy or log loss function (i.e. negative log likelihood)\n",
        "    - Write fit function where gradient descent is implemented\n",
        "    - Write predict_proba function where we predict probabilities for input data\n",
        "- Train the model\n",
        "- Write function for calculating accuracy\n",
        "- Compute accuracy on train and test data\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Further Fun (will not be evaluated)\n",
        "- Play with learning rate and max_iterations\n",
        "- Preprocess data with different feature scaling methods (i.e. scaling, normalization, standardization, etc) and observe accuracies on both X_train and X_test\n",
        "- Train model on different train-test splits such as 60-40, 50-50, 70-30, 80-20, 90-10, 95-5 etc. and observe accuracies on both X_train and X_test\n",
        "- Shuffle training samples with different random seed values in the train_test_split function. Check the model error for the testing data for each setup.\n",
        "- Print other classification metrics such as:\n",
        "    - classification report (sklearn.metrics.classification_report),\n",
